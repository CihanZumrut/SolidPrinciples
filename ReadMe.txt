SOLID PRINCIPLES


BAD DESIGN

How To Identify Bad Design?

-Rigidity : The design is hard to change.
-Fragility : The design is easy to break
-Immobility : The design is hard to do right thing
-Viscosity : It is hard to change

GOOD DESIGN

What are the characteristics of a good design?
-High Cohesion
-Low Coupling

How To Achieve A Good Design
-Follow programming practices of your language/framework
-Follow object oriented design principles
-Use design patterns


What is S.O.L.I.D?

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.
The actual SOLID acronym was, however, identified later by Michael Feathers.
The intention of these principles is to make software designs more understandable, easier to maintain and easier to extend.

1.(S) SRP => Single Responsibility Principle : A class should have only a single responsibility.
2.(O) OCP => Open/Closed Principle : Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3.(L) LSP => Liskov Substitution Principle : Objects in aprogram should be repleceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
4.(I) ISP => Interface Segregation Principle : many client-spesific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
5.(D) DIP => Dependency Inversion Principle : Use lots of interfaces and abstractions.
